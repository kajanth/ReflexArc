## 2024-03-24 - Prevent Server-Side Request Forgery
**Vulnerability:** API caller and alert notification skills make external HTTP requests using user-supplied URLs without verifying their destination. This could allow an attacker to send requests to local networks, such as `127.0.0.1` or the `169.254.169.254` AWS metadata service.
**Learning:** Security fixes must be mindful of `urllib.request` which follows redirects automatically and does not implement internal security checks.
**Prevention:** Implement an `is_safe_url` validation utility that parses URLs and uses `socket.gethostbyname` combined with `ipaddress` validation. Restrict IP addresses from belonging to `.is_private`, `.is_loopback`, `.is_link_local`, or `.is_multicast`. Reject dangerous schemes such as `ftp://` or `file://`.
