## 2024-03-12 - Sync I/O in Asyncio Event Loop
**Learning:** Found several API endpoints (`/stats`, `/memories/recent`, `/skills`) executing synchronous blocking I/O (disk reads, SQLite queries, `os.listdir`) directly on the main event loop thread. While these might be fast locally, under load they stall the entire `aiohttp` web server, preventing it from handling concurrent requests.
**Action:** Always wrap synchronous disk or database operations in `asyncio.to_thread()` when working within an `async def` route handler in `aiohttp` to ensure the event loop remains unblocked.
